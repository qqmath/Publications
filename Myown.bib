Moreover, we prove, that for each r=0,1,2 and any such collection {yi}i=12s there is a 2π - periodic function f∈C(r)(R), such that (−1)i−1f is convex on [yi,yi−1], 1≤i≤2s, and, for each sequence {Tn}n=0∞ of trigonometric polynomials Tn, satisfying (2), we have lim supn→∞nr‖f−Tn‖C(R)ω4(f(r),1∕n)=+∞,where ω4 is the fourth modulus of continuity.}
